Clairvoyance
============

Clairvoyance is an extension to Specs2, a Scala test library. Clairvoyance provides a few extensions to capture what is happening in your tests and then produce business and tester friendly documentation.

It's a pastiche of [Yatspec|http://code.google.com/p/yatspec], a Java testing library written by my colleague Dan Bodart. It addresses all the deficiencies we experienced with Fit and Condordion.
